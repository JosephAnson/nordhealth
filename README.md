# Sign-up Application with Provet Cloud Design System

This repository contains a client-side rendered Nuxt 3 application that allows users to sign up for a product using the Provet Cloud Design System components.

## Design Decisions

- Introduce a vite plugin to automatically import the Provet Cloud Design System components, this is to improve the developer experience and reduce the amount of code needed to be written. It also reduces the amount of errors that can occur due to missing imports.
- Opted to write tests with playwright over vitest, as I can focus on testing the component and not the implementation details. Unfortunately due to working with web components you're unable to use accessiblity first unit testing tools such as testing library when writing tests with vitest, unless you use some workarounds to access the shadow dom however that requires a lot of extra code and is not always reliable. So it's better to use playwright for this.
- Opted to use TailwindCSS over using the Provet Cloud Design System css directly. This was done to better optimise the final bundle size, as importing the entire design system css would be 39kb and by using tailwind I was able to limit that to only 12kb as I wasn't using a lot of the css file. Also by adding the design system variables to the tailwind config I'm able to get tailwind intellisense which can recommend all the available css-variables in the design system, which improves the developer experience.
- Naming convention for components follows: https://vuejs.org/style-guide/rules-strongly-recommended.html#base-component-names
- No store was used in this application as it doesn't require it, depending on the use case a store could be beneficial to track the authenticated user.
- Implemented a server api to simulate a real-world api, if this was a real application I would factor in different error codes, moving the logic into a service layer.
